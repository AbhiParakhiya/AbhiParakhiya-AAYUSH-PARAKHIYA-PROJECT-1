    "1. What is a parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "-->A parameter is a variable internal to the machine learning model whose value is learned from training data. Examples include weights in linear regression or coefficients in logistic regression. Parameters are adjusted during training to minimize loss.\n",
    "(Repeated question, already answered in Q11)\n",
    "Use train_test_split() to split the dataset into training and test parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1. A value near 1 means strong positive relationship, near -1 indicates a strong negative one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> A negative correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. For example, more hours spent watching TV may negatively correlate with academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Machine Learning is a method where machines learn from data to make predictions. Main components include:\n",

    "Model\n",
    "Loss function\n",
    "Optimization algorithm\n",
    "Evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> The loss value quantifies how well a model's predictions match actual outcomes. A lower loss value means better performance. During training, minimizing this loss leads to improved model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Continuous variables are numeric and can take any value (e.g., height, temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables represent discrete labels or classes (e.g., gender, color, city names).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",

    "\n",
    "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Training dataset: Used to fit and train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing dataset: Used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data. It helps in detecting overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> It is a module in Scikit-learn that offers functions for data preprocessing. It includes tools for scaling, encoding, imputing missing values, and transforming features to prepare them for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a Test set?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> A test set is a portion of the dataset used only to assess the performance of a trained model. It is kept separate from the training data to ensure unbiased evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection. It splits the data into training and testing sets:\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Understand the problem\n",

    "\n",
    "Tune hyperparameters and deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> EDA helps understand data distributions, detect outliers, handle missing values, and find relationships between features. It reveals insights that guide preprocessing and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Use .corr() method in Pandas and visualize using a heatmap:\n",

    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Causation means one variable directly affects another. Correlation is just an association.\n",
    "Example: Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated (due to summer), but eating ice cream doesn’t cause drowning.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
    "\n",
