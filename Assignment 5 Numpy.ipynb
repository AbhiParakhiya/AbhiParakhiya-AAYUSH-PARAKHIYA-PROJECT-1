    "1. Memory allocation: NumPy arrays store elements in contiguous blocks of memory. The data type of the elements determines the amount of memory allocated for each element. For example, an int64 array allocates 8 bytes per element, while a float64 array allocates 8 bytes per element as well. Choosing the correct data type can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory access: When accessing elements in a NumPy array, the data type determines how the memory is accessed. For example, accessing an int64 element requires a 64-bit memory access, while accessing a float64 element requires a 64-bit memory access as well. Using the correct data type can improve memory access performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operations and casting: When performing operations on NumPy arrays, the data type of the elements determines the operation's behavior. For example, adding two int64 arrays performs integer addition, while adding two float64 arrays performs floating-point addition. If the data types don't match, NumPy may perform casting, which can lead to performance degradation and potential loss of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cache efficiency: The data type of elements in a NumPy array can affect cache efficiency. For example, an array with a smaller data type (e.g., int32) may fit more elements \n",
